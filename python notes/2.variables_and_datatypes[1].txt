variables :

   Variables are containers for storing data values.
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.


Rules for creating variables:

    1.Variables start with a letter or underscore
         Ex:_abc,abc....
     2.do not start with a digits
     3.Variables are case sensitive for example age,Age can be considered as a different names.

Example:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Example
x = 4         # x is of type int
x = "Sowmiya" # x is now of type str
print(x)

Datatypes:

  Data Types are used to define the type of a variable.
  It defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable. 
  The data stored in memory can be of many types.

 built-in data types

Numeric - int, float, complex
String - str
Sequence - list, tuple, range
Mapping - dict
Boolean - bool
Set - set

Numeric Data Type
Python numeric data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them.

var1 = 1       # int data type
var2 = True    # bool data type
var3 = 10.023  # float data type
var4 = 10+3j   # complex data type

type(123)

output:
<class 'int'>

type(9.99)

output:
<class 'float'>

type(5+6j)

output:
<class 'complex'>

type (True)

output:
<class 'bool'>

type(False)

output:
<class 'bool'>


# integer variable.
a=100
print("The type of variable having value", a, " is ", type(a))

b=True
print("The type of variable having value", b, " is ", type(b))

c=20.345
print("The type of variable having value", c, " is ", type(c))


d=10+3j
print("The type of variable having value", d, " is ", type(d))


Casting:
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    
y = int(3)   
z = float(3) 

Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

a = 4
A = "Sally"
print(a)
print(A)
